# Listener app assets

Add an animated GIF named **listening.gif** to this folder. It is shown on the Listener Dashboard when listening is active.

You can use any "listening", "headphones", or "audio wave" GIF from free asset sites (e.g. Giphy, LottieFiles) or provide your own. Recommended size: roughly square or landscape, around 200–400 px wide.
