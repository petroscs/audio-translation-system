# Translator app assets

Add an animated GIF named **broadcasting.gif** to this folder. It is shown on the Translator Dashboard when broadcasting is active.

You can use any "on air", "live", or "broadcasting" GIF from free asset sites (e.g. Giphy, LottieFiles) or provide your own. Recommended size: roughly square or landscape, around 200–400 px wide.
