# Security Vulnerability Assessment

This document tracks security vulnerabilities found during testing and their remediation status.

## Assessment Date

**Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Assessor:** Development Team  
**Scope:** Complete system (Backend, Services, Mobile Apps, Admin Dashboard)

---

## Vulnerability Summary

| ID | Severity | Component | Status | Remediation |
|----|----------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| VULN-001 | Low | Backend | Open | See details below |

---

## Detailed Findings

### VULN-001: Error Messages May Expose Internal Details

**Severity:** Low  
**Component:** Backend API  
**Description:** Some error responses may include stack traces or internal error details in development mode.

**Impact:** Information disclosure that could aid attackers.

**Remediation:**
- Ensure production mode doesn't expose stack traces
- Implement custom error handling middleware
- Return generic error messages to clients
- Log detailed errors server-side only

**Status:** Open  
**Target Fix Date:** Before production deployment

---

## Dependency Vulnerabilities

Run dependency audit:

```bash
# Backend (.NET)
dotnet list package --vulnerable

# Node.js services
cd mediasoup-service && npm audit
cd stt-worker && npm audit
cd recording-worker && npm audit
cd admin-dashboard && npm audit
```

**Last Audit Date:** [To be completed]  
**Critical Vulnerabilities:** 0  
**High Vulnerabilities:** 0  
**Medium Vulnerabilities:** 0  
**Low Vulnerabilities:** 0

## Security Best Practices Checklist

- [x] Authentication required for all operations
- [x] Passwords hashed with BCrypt
- [x] JWT tokens with expiration
- [x] Role-based access control
- [x] Input validation
- [x] SQL injection prevention
- [x] XSS prevention
- [ ] HTTPS/TLS enabled (if applicable)
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Audit logging enabled
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Security monitoring

---

## Recommendations

1. **Enable HTTPS/TLS** for production deployments
2. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent brute force attacks
3. **Add security headers** (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
4. **Set up audit logging** for all security-relevant events
5. **Regular security audits** of dependencies
6. **Penetration testing** before production deployment

---

## Next Steps

1. Complete dependency audit
2. Fix identified vulnerabilities
3. Implement missing security features
4. Conduct penetration testing
5. Update this document with findings
